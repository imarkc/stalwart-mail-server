# Contributing

## Contributions are Temporarily Limited

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Stalwart. We appreciate the support and enthusiasm of the open-source community. However, at this stage of the project, we are **limiting the scope of external contributions**.

Stalwart is currently **not accepting external contributions**, except for bug fixes and small, well-scoped changes. The project is approaching version 1.0, and as we move toward this milestone, development is progressing rapidly. The architecture of Stalwart is still evolving, and many internal components are subject to change.

Due to these ongoing changes and the fast pace of development, we do not have the time or resources to thoroughly review and integrate most pull requests. Accepting broad contributions at this time could lead to confusion and unnecessary rework for both contributors and maintainers.

While we are not accepting most code contributions, you can still support the project in meaningful ways. Reporting bugs, providing feedback, and helping test the software are all valuable forms of participation. If you encounter an issue, please open a detailed report that includes steps to reproduce the problem and any relevant logs or context. We also welcome thoughtful suggestions and questions through our issue tracker or discussion channels.

We plan to open the project to broader contributions once we reach a stable 1.0 release. At that point, with a more mature architecture and clearer development roadmap, we will be better positioned to collaborate with the community. We will update this policy accordingly when the time comes.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Weâ€™re excited about the future of Stalwart and look forward to working with the community in the near future.

## Fiduciary Contributor License Agreement

Before making any contributions, all contributors are required to sign the Fiduciary Contributor License Agreement (FLA). The FLA is a legal agreement that assigns the copyright of contributions to a designated fiduciary, who manages these rights on behalf of the project. This arrangement ensures that the software remains free and open, even as contributors come and go.

Key points of the FLA:

- Ensures the software remains free and open source
- Protects the project from potential copyright issues
- Includes a reversion clause: if the fiduciary violates Free Software principles, rights revert to the original contributors

For more details about FLA, please refer to the [FLA FAQ](https://fsfe.org/activities/fla/fla.en.html).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
